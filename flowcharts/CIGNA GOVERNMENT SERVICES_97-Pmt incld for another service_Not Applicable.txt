Here's a decision tree flowchart for handling claims denied due to "Payment Included in Other Services":

1. Review the claim denial in the billing system (BT or CGS web portal).
   - Confirm the denial reason is "97-Pmt incld for another service".

2. Check patient's enrollment status during the service dates:
   - Use CGS web portal or Medicare portal to verify patient's status.
   - Look for enrollment in SNF (Skilled Nursing Facility), Hospice, or Home Health Episode.

3. If patient was in SNF:
   a. Create a new service order (SO) for the discharge date.
   b. Add a new invoice with the correct discharge date.
   c. Adjust the original claim.
   d. Rebill with the new SO and invoice number.

4. If patient was in Hospice:
   a. Verify the hospice enrollment dates.
   b. Adjust the claim as necessary.
   c. If HCPCS code is already picked up, note in the system.

5. If patient was in Home Health Episode:
   a. Review LCD Guidelines for the specific HCPCS code.
   b. If the item is not separately payable during Home Health Episode, adjust the balance.
   c. If payable, create a new SO and rebill.

6. For purchase claims (e.g., E0141, E0165):
   a. Create a new SO for the discharge date.
   b. Bill with the new SO and invoice number.
   c. Adjust off the previous date of service.

7. For rental claims (e.g., E0431, E1390):
   a. Add backend billing for the rental period.
   b. Adjust the claim accordingly.

8. If the patient is deceased:
   a. Verify the date of death in the billing system.
   b. Close the service order if not already done.
   c. Adjust the claim as per SOP for deceased patients.

9. If none of the above scenarios apply:
   a. Review the claim for any other potential issues.
   b. Contact the insurance provider for more information if needed.
   c. Consider appealing the denial with supporting documentation.

10. After taking appropriate action:
    a. Post the adjustment in the billing system.
    b. Update the claim notes with actions taken.
    c. If applicable, resubmit the adjusted claim.

11. If unable to resolve:
    a. Escalate to a supervisor or specialized team.
    b. Document all actions taken in the claim notes.
