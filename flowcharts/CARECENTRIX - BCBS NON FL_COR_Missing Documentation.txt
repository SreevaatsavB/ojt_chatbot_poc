1. Review claim status in BT (Billing Tool) or CCX portal
   - Verify claim submission date and denial reason

2. Check BDM (Billing Document Management) for available documents
   - Look for RX, CMN, clinical notes, DT (Delivery Ticket), sleep study, compliance report

3. If required documents are available in BDM:
   a. Send reconsideration/appeal via CCX web portal
   b. Include all relevant medical records
   c. Note the reference number or ticket number

4. If required documents are not available in BDM:
   a. Task client for missing medical records
   b. Wait for client response

5. Once documents are received or if no response from client:
   a. Send reconsideration/appeal via CCX web portal
   b. Include all available medical records
   c. Note the reference number or ticket number

6. Upload all sent documents to BDM for future reference

7. Follow up on appeal status:
   a. Call insurance (use provided phone number, e.g., 877-725-6525)
   b. Speak with representative and note their name
   c. Record appeal status (received, forwarded to health plan, still in process, etc.)

8. If appeal is not received by insurance:
   a. Resend appeal with all necessary documents
   b. Note new reference number or ticket number

9. Allow appropriate processing time (60-120 days, as indicated by insurance)

10. If claim is still denied after appeal:
    a. Check for any additional appeal options
    b. If no further appeal options, adjust claim as per client update

11. For recurring denials:
    a. Review previous successful appeals for the same issue
    b. Use similar approach for current denial

12. Continuously monitor claim status in BT and CCX portal

13. If claim remains unresolved:
    a. Escalate to supervisor or specialized team
    b. Consider contacting provider or patient for additional information if needed

This workflow provides a structured approach for new agents to handle claim denials due to missing documentation, covering various scenarios while maintaining simplicity.
