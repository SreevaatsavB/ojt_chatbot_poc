Based on the provided claim denial scenarios, here's a decision tree flowchart for new AR team agents to handle claims denied due to "Covered by other payer":

1. Review the claim in BT (Billing Tool) to check submission status and denial reason.

2. Verify patient's insurance coverage:
   a. Check Medicaid portal for active coverage and any MCO plans.
   b. If applicable, check other insurance portals (e.g., UHC, CGS) for primary coverage.

3. Analyze the EOB (Explanation of Benefits):
   a. Review primary and secondary payment amounts for each HCPCS code.
   b. Check if primary paid more than secondary allowed amount.

4. If primary paid more than secondary allowed:
   a. Adjust the claim as Medicaid waiver in BT.
   b. Post the adjustment.

5. If primary coverage is unclear:
   a. Call the insurance representative for member information.
   b. If member not found, follow SOP for Medicaid plan (e.g., bill to patient).

6. Check if the HCPCS code is covered by Medicaid:
   a. If not covered, adjust the balance as Medicaid Waiver.
   b. If covered, proceed to next step.

7. Verify if the provider is contracted with the primary insurance:
   a. If non-contracted, transfer balance to patient and create equipment pick-up if applicable.
   b. If contracted, proceed to next step.

8. Check for any missing information (e.g., re-qualification documents):
   a. If missing, task client for assistance in obtaining documents.
   b. If all information is present, proceed to next step.

9. If denial persists:
   a. Adjust the balance in BT as per the correct denial.
   b. Post the adjustment.

10. If further assistance is needed:
    a. Escalate to a supervisor.
    b. Consider appealing the claim with necessary documentation.

This flowchart covers the main scenarios encountered in the provided examples while keeping the process simple for new agents to follow.
