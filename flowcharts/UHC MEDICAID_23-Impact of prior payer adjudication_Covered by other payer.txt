Claim denied due to "Covered by other payer" or "Covered by HMO plan":

1. Review claim status in Brightree (BT)
   - If claim has been submitted, proceed to step 2
   - If claim has not been submitted, skip to step 4

2. Check EOB for denial reason
   - Confirm denial is due to coverage by other payer or HMO plan

3. Verify claim crossover status
   - If claim crossed over to Medicaid and was denied, proceed to step 4
   - If claim did not cross over, skip to step 5

4. Check patient eligibility
   - Verify in Medicaid website for UHC secondary status
   - Check eligibility in UHC web portal and Brightree
   - Confirm active status for the date of service (DOS)

5. Determine correct payer
   - If UHC Medicaid is identified as the correct payer, proceed to step 6
   - If another payer is identified, skip to step 8

6. Check UHC portal for claim status
   - If claim is found, review details and proceed to step 7
   - If claim is not found, skip to step 8

7. Verify timely filing limit (TFL)
   - If within TFL, proceed to step 8
   - If TFL has been exceeded, consider appeal options or write-off

8. Resubmit or rebill claim
   - Submit to correct payer (e.g., UHC Medicaid)
   - Include primary EOB if applicable
   - Ensure all required information is included (e.g., authorization if needed)

9. Monitor claim status
   - Check BT and payer portal for claim processing updates
   - If claim is processed successfully, close the case
   - If claim is denied again, return to step 1 and reassess

10. If all attempts to resolve fail
    - Consider appealing the denial with supporting documentation
    - Consult with supervisor for further actions or potential write-off
