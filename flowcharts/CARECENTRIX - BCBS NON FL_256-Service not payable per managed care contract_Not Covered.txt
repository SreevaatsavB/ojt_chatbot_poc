1. Review claim status in BT (Billing Tool) and check EOB (Explanation of Benefits).

2. Verify denial reason:
   a. If "Service not payable per managed care contract," proceed to step 3.
   b. If "Non-covered per patient policy," skip to step 7.

3. Check billing modifiers:
   a. Review CCX (CareCentrix) crosswalk for correct modifiers.
   b. Verify if NU modifier is required for CPAP supplies.
   c. Confirm if RR modifier is needed for rental equipment.

4. Compare with previous paid claims for the same patient to ensure consistent modifier usage.

5. If incorrect modifiers were used:
   a. Prepare a corrected claim with the appropriate modifiers.
   b. Submit the corrected claim electronically.
   c. Note the timely filing limit (usually 60 days from DOS).

6. If modifiers were correct or after submitting a corrected claim:
   a. Call insurance (CareCentrix) to verify claim status.
   b. If claim is still in process, allow normal processing time (usually 30-60 days).
   c. If claim is finalized but payment not updated, allow 10 business days.

7. Check patient's account status:
   a. Review portal for client notes.
   b. Call home plan to verify if the patient has an outstanding balance.

8. If patient has an outstanding balance or suspension of services:
   a. Task the client to contact the member about paying the outstanding balance.
   b. Instruct to bill the patient as per client response or portal notes.

9. If claim is still denied after all above steps:
   a. Review authorization requirements in BDM (Benefit Design Manager).
   b. If authorization is required and missing, obtain and submit with a new claim.
   c. If authorization is not required or present, consider filing an appeal with necessary documentation.

10. For all actions taken:
    a. Document all steps, conversations, and decisions in the claim notes.
    b. Set appropriate follow-up tasks or reminders for pending actions.

11. If the claim remains unresolved after exhausting all options:
    a. Escalate to a supervisor or specialized team for further review.
