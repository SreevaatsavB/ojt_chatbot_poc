Based on the provided actions, here's a decision tree flowchart for handling non-covered claim denials:

1. Review claim submission in the billing system
   - Verify claim submission date, payer, and claim details

2. Check claim status in Availity or other relevant portal
   - If claim is processed, note the denial reason
   - If claim is pending, allow more time for processing

3. Verify member eligibility
   - Check if the member is active for the date of service
   - Confirm primary and secondary insurance information

4. If claim was submitted to incorrect payer:
   - Identify the correct payer
   - Resubmit the claim to the correct payer

5. For non-covered charges:
   - Check if DME is covered under the plan
   - Verify if authorization is required

6. If authorization is required:
   - Check authorization status
   - If no valid authorization exists, consider appealing or billing the patient

7. Call insurance representative
   - Confirm coverage details
   - Verify if HCPCS codes are covered under the contract
   - Ask about any pending reviews or appeals

8. If an appeal is necessary:
   - Submit the appeal with required documentation
   - Follow up on the appeal status after the specified review period (e.g., 120 business days)

9. If coverage is confirmed as non-existent:
   - Task the client for guidance on next steps
   - Consider billing the patient if appropriate

10. If claim is still pending review:
    - Note the status in the system
    - Set a follow-up date to check again

11. Document all actions and findings in the claim notes

12. If all options are exhausted and the claim remains denied:
    - Consider writing off the claim or billing the patient, based on company policy
