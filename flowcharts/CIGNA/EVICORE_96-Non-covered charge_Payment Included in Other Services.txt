Here's a decision tree flowchart for handling non-covered claim denials:

1. Review claim status in Billing Transaction (BT) software
   - Confirm denial reason is "Non-covered charge"

2. Check payment history for the same HCPCS code
   - If previous payment found, proceed to step 3
   - If no previous payment, skip to step 6

3. Call insurance (CIGNA/EVICORE) for clarification
   - Verify if the code is payable under the provider contract
   - If payable, request reprocessing and allow 30-45 business days
   - If not payable, proceed to step 4

4. Verify network status with insurance
   - Confirm if we are an in-network provider
   - If in-network, proceed to step 5
   - If out-of-network, skip to step 7

5. Escalate claim to insurance
   - Submit for review with updated provider information
   - If denied again, proceed to step 6

6. Gather supporting documentation
   - Collect ORDER, PROGRESS NOTES, and DT (Delivery Ticket)
   - Submit appeal through insurance portal
   - Include reference to denial date and claim number
   - Note that Time Frame Limit (TFL) is 180 days from denial date

7. Check member's eligibility
   - Verify Date of Death (DOD) in relation to Date of Service (DOS)
   - If DOS is after DOD, adjust the claim accordingly

8. Review CMS guidelines
   - Confirm if the claim should be submitted as rental
   - If rental, create new SO (Service Order) and submit corrected claim

9. If all above steps fail:
   - Task the client for further assistance
   - Consider billing the patient if appropriate under the plan

10. Document all actions taken in the claim notes
    - Include reference numbers, representative names, and call dates

This flowchart covers the main scenarios encountered in the provided claim notes and offers a structured approach for new agents to handle non-covered claim denials.
