Here's a decision tree flowchart for handling claim denials due to missing attachments:

1. Review claim denial in BT (Billing Tool)
   - Confirm denial reason is "252-Attachment is required" or similar

2. Check EOB (Explanation of Benefits)
   - Verify specific attachments or medical records requested

3. Review BDM (Billing Document Management) for available documents
   - Look for: DT (Detailed Written Order), CMN (Certificate of Medical Necessity), progress notes, sleep study, auth sheet, compliance report

4. Determine if all required documents are available
   - If yes, proceed to step 5
   - If no, go to step 4a

   4a. Task client or appropriate team to obtain missing documents
       - Return to step 3 when documents are received

5. Prepare appeal package
   - Include all relevant medical records and documents found in BDM

6. Check insurance portal for submission method
   - Determine if submission should be via web portal or fax

7. Submit appeal
   - If web portal: Upload documents and submit through insurance portal
   - If fax: Send documents to provided fax number

8. Note the Timeline for Filing (TFL)
   - Usually 35 days from denial date for OSCAR claims

9. Upload appeal confirmation and documents to BDM

10. Monitor claim status
    - Check insurance portal or BT regularly for updates

11. If claim is still denied after appeal
    - Review new denial reason and return to step 1
    - Consider escalation to supervisor if multiple appeals have been unsuccessful

12. If claim is approved
    - Update claim status in BT
    - Close the case

This flowchart covers the general process for handling attachment-related denials, with a focus on using BT, BDM, and insurance portals for claim management and appeal submission.
