Based on the provided actions for claims denied due to "Claim recently submitted," here's a decision tree flowchart for new agents to follow:

1. Verify claim submission status in the claims management system.

2. If claim is not found in the system:
   a. Submit the claim to the payer
   b. Document the submission details and date

3. If claim is found in the system:
   a. Check the submission date
   b. If submitted within the last 30 days, proceed to step 4
   c. If submitted more than 30 days ago, go to step 7

4. Follow up with the payer:
   a. Contact payer's customer service
   b. Inquire about the claim status
   c. Document the conversation and any information received

5. If payer confirms claim is received and processing:
   a. Note the expected processing time
   b. Schedule a follow-up based on the payer's timeline

6. If payer has no record of the claim:
   a. Verify claim details in the claims management system
   b. Resubmit the claim if necessary
   c. Document the resubmission

7. Review claim details:
   a. Check for accuracy and completeness of information
   b. Verify patient demographics, insurance information, and service details
   c. Ensure all required fields are filled correctly

8. If any discrepancies are found:
   a. Correct the information in the claims management system
   b. Resubmit the corrected claim
   c. Document the changes and resubmission

9. If no discrepancies are found:
   a. Monitor the claim status regularly
   b. Set a reminder to check status every 7-10 days

10. If claim remains unprocessed after payer's stated timeline:
    a. Escalate to a supervisor or specialized team
    b. Consider filing an appeal or complaint with the payer
    c. Document all actions taken and continue to monitor

11. Once claim is processed:
    a. Review the outcome
    b. If paid, close the case
    c. If denied for a different reason, start a new workflow based on the new denial reason

This flowchart provides a structured approach for new agents to handle claims denied due to recent submission, covering various scenarios while keeping the process simple and easy to follow.
