Here's a decision tree flowchart for handling claim denials due to Rental/Purchase Limit:

1. Review claim status in Billing Tool (BT)
   - Check denial reason and date
   - Verify claim submission history

2. Check payment history
   - Confirm number of payments received
   - Verify if rental cap or purchase price has been met

3. If rental cap not met or fewer than expected payments received:
   a. Send reconsideration
      - Include supporting documentation (RX, CMN, sleep study, progress notes, compliance data)
   b. Follow up on reconsideration status after 30 days
      - If upheld, proceed to step 4
      - If approved, monitor for payment

4. Send appeal
   - Include all relevant medical records and documentation
   - Submit via web portal or appropriate method

5. Follow up on appeal status
   - Call insurance (CareCentrix for BCBS) every 30 days
   - Check if appeal was received and forwarded to health plan

6. If appeal is still in review:
   - Allow 120 business days for processing
   - Continue to follow up regularly

7. If appeal is denied:
   a. Check if further appeal levels are available
      - If yes, submit next level appeal
      - If no, proceed to step 8
   b. Verify with insurance if max rental is truly met

8. If all appeal options exhausted and denial upheld:
   a. For partial payments received:
      - Adjust off remaining balance
   b. For no payments received:
      - Task to client for approval on next steps

9. Throughout the process:
   - Document all actions in claim notes
   - Upload all correspondence and appeal documents in BDM (Billing Document Management)

10. If at any point insurance confirms error or approves claim:
    - Monitor for payment
    - If payment not received within 30 days, follow up with insurance

Remember to always verify claim status and previous actions in BT before taking any new steps to avoid duplicate efforts.
