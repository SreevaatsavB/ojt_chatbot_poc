Based on the provided claim notes, here's a decision tree for handling claims denied due to missing information or lack of adjudication:

1. Review claim status in BT (Billing Tool)
   - Check submission date and initial denial reason

2. Verify denial reason in EOB (Explanation of Benefits)
   - Confirm if denial is due to lack of adjudication information or authorization

3. Check BDM (Benefit Documentation Management) for authorization
   - Verify if valid authorization exists for the date of service (DOS)
   - If authorization exists, proceed to step 4
   - If no authorization exists, proceed to step 5

4. Authorization exists:
   - Prepare appeal with authorization information
   - Submit appeal via fax or appropriate method
   - Allow 30 business days for processing

5. No authorization exists:
   - Check if retro authorization is possible
   - If retro authorization is possible, request it from the client
   - If not possible, proceed to step 6

6. No retro authorization possible:
   - For rental claims: Adjust the claim and add to backend
   - For purchase claims: Adjust the claim as per SOP

7. If denial persists or additional information is needed:
   - Task the client for assistance or clarification
   - Wait for client response (typically allow 3-5 business days)

8. Upon receiving client response:
   - If new authorization is provided, rebill the claim with updated information
   - If instructed to write off, adjust the claim accordingly

9. For partially paid claims:
   - Verify which codes were paid and which were denied
   - Adjust only the denied portion if necessary

10. If appeal is upheld:
    - Review the reason for continued denial
    - Consider contacting the UM (Utilization Management) department for further assistance

11. For ongoing denials:
    - Create a PU (Follow-up) ticket to track the authorization request process
    - Continue to monitor and follow up as needed

12. If all options are exhausted:
    - Adjust the claim as per company policy
    - Document all actions taken in the claim notes

Remember to always document each action taken in the claim notes and follow any specific instructions provided by the client or insurance carrier.
