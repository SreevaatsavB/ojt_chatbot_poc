Here's a decision tree flowchart for handling claim denials due to missing authorization:

1. Review the claim in BT (Billing Tool) to verify submission date and initial denial reason.

2. Check the EOB (Explanation of Benefits) for specific denial details.

3. Verify authorization status:
   a. Check in BDM (Billing Data Management) system
   b. Check in Coastal Care web portal
   c. Check any available authorization sheets

4. If authorization is found and valid for the DOS (Date of Service):
   a. Prepare an appeal with the authorization information
   b. Send the appeal via fax to Coastal Care (855-481-0606)

5. If no authorization is found or authorization is invalid:
   a. Check if retro authorization is possible according to SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)
   b. If retro auth is possible, task the client for authorization approval

6. If retro authorization is not possible:
   a. For rental items:
      - Adjust the claim
      - Add backend rentals if future authorization is available
   b. For purchase codes:
      - Adjust the claim balance
      - Write off the amount as per SOP

7. If the denial is due to a plan change:
   a. Review plan requirements
   b. Contact the UM (Utilization Management) department of Coastal Care for clarification

8. If authorization was previously not required but now is:
   a. Document the change in requirements
   b. Adjust the claim as per new requirements

9. For partially paid claims with some codes denied:
   a. Verify authorization for each code separately
   b. Adjust only the denied codes if no authorization is found

10. If the claim is for a date between two valid authorization periods:
    a. Check if there's a gap in coverage
    b. If so, adjust the claim for the gap period

11. For all adjustments and write-offs:
    a. Document actions taken in the claim notes
    b. Update the claim status in BT

12. If unsure about any step or encountering an unusual situation:
    a. Consult with a supervisor or experienced team member
    b. Document the consultation and decision in the claim notes

This flowchart covers the main scenarios encountered in the provided claim notes while keeping the process as simple as possible for new agents to follow.
