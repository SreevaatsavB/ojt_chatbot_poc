Claim denied due to primary insurance paying more than secondary insurance allowed amount:

1. Review claim in BT (Billing Tool) to verify claim status and denial reason.

2. Check EOB (Explanation of Benefits) to confirm primary payment and secondary allowed amount.

3. Compare primary payment to secondary allowed amount:
   a. If primary paid less than or equal to secondary allowed, proceed to step 4.
   b. If primary paid more than secondary allowed, proceed to step 5.

4. If primary paid less than or equal to secondary allowed:
   a. Verify claim submission details in BT.
   b. Call insurance to inquire about denial reason.
   c. If error found, correct and resubmit claim.
   d. If no error found, file an appeal with supporting documentation.

5. If primary paid more than secondary allowed:
   a. Check Medicaid fee schedule to confirm allowed amount.
   b. Verify if the HCPCS code is covered by Medicaid:
      - If covered, proceed to step 6.
      - If not covered (e.g., PAP supplies), proceed to step 7.

6. For covered HCPCS codes:
   a. Adjust the claim as Medicaid waiver per SOP (Standard Operating Procedure).
   b. Write off the remaining balance.

7. For non-covered HCPCS codes (e.g., PAP supplies):
   a. Adjust the claim as Medicaid waiver per SOP.
   b. Write off the entire amount.

8. If claim is for a patient in SNF (Skilled Nursing Facility):
   a. Check CGs (Coverage Guidelines) to verify patient's SNF enrollment.
   b. If in SNF, adjust the claim per SOP as no further payments can be made by secondary.

9. For recurring denials or global denial issues:
   a. Task RCM (Revenue Cycle Management) team for further assistance.
   b. Follow up on RCM response and take recommended actions.

10. Document all actions taken in the claim notes in BT.

11. If unable to resolve or unsure of next steps, escalate to a supervisor or senior team member for guidance.
