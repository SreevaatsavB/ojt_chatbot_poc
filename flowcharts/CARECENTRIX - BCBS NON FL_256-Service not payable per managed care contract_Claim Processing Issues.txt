     b. If premium unpaid, transfer balance to patient
     c. If premium paid, proceed to step 3

3. Check claim history
   - Review previous notes and actions taken

4. Verify patient information
   - Check Availity for eligibility and coverage

5. If claim is not on file:
   - Verify mailing address and payer ID
   - Check authorization requirements
   - Resubmit claim electronically

6. If claim is rejected as duplicate:
   - Submit as a corrected claim
   - Ensure to submit within 60 days of DOS (Date of Service)

7. If claim is rejected due to invalid information:

   - Call insurance (e.g., CareCentrix) to verify current status
   - Note the last update date and allow processing time if within 60-day TAT

9. If claim is denied due to missing attachment:
   - Verify if corrected claim with attachment was submitted

    - Monitor patient's premium payment status
    - Once premium is paid, submit a corrected claim

12. If multiple DOS (Dates of Service) are involved:
    - Ensure all DOS are submitted correctly
    - Submit corrected claims for any missed or incorrectly submitted DOS

13. If all above steps are exhausted and claim is still denied:
    - Consider filing an appeal with necessary documentation

14. Throughout the process:
    - Document all actions taken in the claim notes
