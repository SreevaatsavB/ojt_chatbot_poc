Claim denied due to primary paid more than secondary allowable:

1. Review claim in BT (Billing Tool) to check claim status and payment details.

2. Check EOB (Explanation of Benefits) for primary and secondary payment amounts.

3. If EOB doesn't show allowable amount, check in Availity portal.

4. If still unable to find allowable amount, call insurance (Simply Health Care at 877-915-0551) to verify denial reason and get secondary allowable amount.

5. Compare primary payment to secondary allowable amount:
   a. If primary paid less than or equal to secondary allowable, request reprocessing.
   b. If primary paid more than secondary allowable, proceed to step 6.

6. Check if the denied items are covered by Medicaid:
   a. If not covered (e.g., PAP supplies, CPAP supplies), adjust claim as Medicaid waiver.
   b. If covered, proceed to step 7.

7. For Medicaid-covered items:
   a. If first denial, send appeal through web and TFL (Timely Filing Limit).
   b. If second denial, send 2nd level appeal within 180 days from denial date.

8. Upload all appeal documents in BDM (Billing Document Management).

9. If appeal is successful, monitor for reprocessing and payment.

10. If appeal is unsuccessful or not applicable, adjust claim as Medicaid waiver.

11. For future claims, document the process and outcome for reference.
