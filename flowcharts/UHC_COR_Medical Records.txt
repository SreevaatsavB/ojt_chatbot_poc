Based on the provided claim notes, here's a decision tree for handling claim denials due to missing medical records:

1. Review claim denial in billing software (BT/FT/Payspan)
   - Verify denial reason is "Missing Medical Records" or similar

2. Check available documents in BDM (Billing Document Management)
   - Look for CMN, DT, progress notes, sleep study, compliance report, and written orders

3. If all required documents are available in BDM:
   a. Prepare appeal with available documents
   b. Submit appeal via insurance web portal
   c. Upload appeal documents to BDM
   d. Note the appeal ticket number and timeline for follow-up (usually 90 days)

4. If documents are missing or outdated:
   a. Task the client for updated medical documents
   b. Specify exactly which documents are needed (e.g., F2F progress notes, sleep study, compliance report)
   c. Wait for client response

5. Once client provides requested documents:
   a. Review received documents for completeness
   b. Upload new documents to BDM
   c. Prepare appeal with all available documents
   d. Submit appeal via insurance web portal
   e. Note the appeal ticket number and timeline for follow-up

6. If claim is still pending after appeal submission:
   a. Check claim status in insurance portal after specified processing time (e.g., 7-10 business days)
   b. If no update, call insurance (e.g., Optum for UHC) to inquire about status
   c. If necessary, send escalation request to expedite claim processing

7. If claim is denied again or partially paid:
   a. Review new denial reason
   b. If it's a different issue, start a new workflow for that specific denial reason
   c. If it's the same issue, consider sending a second appeal with any additional documentation or explanation

8. Throughout the process:
   a. Maintain detailed notes in the claim management system
   b. Adhere to timely filing limits (TFL) for appeals (e.g., 90 days, 180 days)
   c. Ensure all actions are documented with dates, reference numbers, and representative names when applicable

9. If all appeal options are exhausted:
   a. Consult with a supervisor for next steps
   b. Consider writing off the claim if further action is deemed futile

This workflow should help new agents navigate the process of addressing claim denials due to missing medical records, ensuring they take appropriate steps and utilize the necessary software systems throughout the resolution process.
