Based on the provided claim denial scenarios, here's a decision tree flowchart for new agents to handle claim denials:

1. Review claim status in Payspan EOB
   - If claim is paid but not posted in Caretend:
     a. Calculate paid amount
     b. If balance is less than $6.00:
        - Post payment and adjust balance in Caretend
     c. If balance is $6.00 or more:
        - Investigate discrepancy and take appropriate action

2. If claim is denied:
   a. Check denial reason
   
   b. If denied for medical records (MRE):
      - Submit appeal with medical records
      - If no response:
        - Forward appeal to Quantum for review
        - Contact Quantum for appeal status
        - If AOR form is required:
          - Request AOR form from patient
          - Inform client about AOR requirement

   c. If denied due to inpatient status:
      - Call insurance to confirm denial reason and inpatient dates
      - Adjust claim as per SOP for inpatient stay
      - Post adjustment in Caretend

   d. If denied due to modifier issues:
      - Submit corrected claim with proper modifiers
      - Follow up on corrected claim status

3. For all denials:
   - Document all actions taken in claim notes
   - Include relevant details such as:
     - Date of service (DOS)
     - HCPCS codes
     - Insurance carrier name
     - Claim number
     - Call reference numbers (if applicable)

4. If denial persists after initial actions:
