   c. If required, also fax F2F SS (Face-to-Face Supporting Statement) to the same number.

4. If the claim is paid but not posted in Caretend:
   a. Review the payment details in Payspan EOB.
   b. Calculate the paid amount to verify the payment.
   c. If the balance is less than $6.00, post the payment and adjust the balance in Caretend.

5. If the claim is marked as "Non-workable":
   a. Review the claim status to confirm it's non-workable.
