1. Review claim status in BT (Billing Tool)
   - Check if claim has been submitted to CareCentrix (CCX)
   - Verify denial reason: "Service not payable per managed care contract"

2. Check EOB (Explanation of Benefits) in BT
   - Confirm denial reason matches "Service not payable per managed care contract"

3. Verify denial reason in CareCentrix portal
   - Ensure consistency with BT and EOB information

4. Call CareCentrix customer service
   - Inquire about specific reason for denial
   - Ask if member has unpaid premium or if services are suspended

5. If confirmed member has not paid premium:
   a. Transfer balance to patient pay in BT
   b. Bill the patient for the outstanding amount
   c. Inform patient that services are suspended until premium is paid
   d. Note that claim will be processed once premium is paid

6. If reason is unclear or different from unpaid premium:
   a. Submit a reconsideration request through the CareCentrix portal
   b. Include relevant documentation (Medical History, Progress notes, Order, Auth sheet, DT)
   c. Follow up on reconsideration status after 30 days

7. If reconsideration is denied:
   a. Review denial reason
   b. If still related to unpaid premium, return to step 5
   c. If different reason, consider filing an appeal with additional supporting documentation

8. For duplicate claim rejections:
   a. Submit a corrected claim in BT instead of a fresh claim
   b. Ensure to mark it as a corrected claim to avoid further duplicate rejections

9. Document all actions taken in the claim notes in BT

10. Set a follow-up date to check claim status if no response is received within 30 days

11. If all attempts to resolve the denial are unsuccessful:
    a. Consult with a supervisor for further guidance
    b. Consider writing off the claim if all options are exhausted and documented

Remember to always verify the most current date of service and check for any updates in the patient's premium payment status before taking action.
