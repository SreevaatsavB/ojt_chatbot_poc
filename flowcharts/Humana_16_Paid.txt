Based on the provided claim notes, here's a decision tree flowchart for handling "Paid" or "Paid Balance Adjustment" denials:

1. Review claim in software (Caretend/Connect)
   - Check payment status and details

2. Check in Waystar
   - Look for EOB
   - If EOB found, review details
   - If no EOB found, proceed to next step

3. Check in Availity
   - Verify claim processing details
   - Check allowed amount and payment information
   - Compare with fee schedule

4. If payment is correct as per fee schedule:
   - Download EOB from web portal
   - Place EOB in path BKTask for client to post payment

5. If payment is partial or incorrect:
   - Calculate the difference between allowed amount and paid amount
   - If difference is small (less than $6):
     - Adjust as small dollar adjustment
     - Task claim to client for adjustment
   - If difference is significant:
     - Place adjustment form in Connect
     - Task client to adjust remaining balance as Contractual Adjustment

6. If denial reason is due to DX code:
   - Review billing note history
   - Check if claim was resubmitted with correct DX code
   - If resubmitted and paid, follow steps 4 or 5

7. If payment is missing for specific codes (e.g., S0164):
   - Review previous invoices for similar denials
   - If code is not recognized by Medicare Advantage plans:
     - Place Adjustment form in Connect
     - Task client to adjust balance as contractual adjustment

8. If claim requires reprocessing:
   - Call insurance (e.g., Humana)
   - Provide necessary information (e.g., fee schedule findings)
   - Request claim reprocessing
   - Document reprocess ticket number
   - Set follow-up for 14-30 business days

9. If appeal is necessary:
   - Submit appeal with required documentation
   - Check claim status in Waystar after 2-3 weeks
   - If processed, follow steps 4 or 5
   - If not processed, call insurance for status update

10. For all actions:
    - Document all steps taken in the claim notes
    - Set appropriate follow-up reminders

This flowchart covers the main scenarios encountered in the provided claim notes and offers a structured approach for new agents to handle "Paid" or "Paid Balance Adjustment" denials.
