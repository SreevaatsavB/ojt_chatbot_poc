Based on the provided claim denial scenarios for "Exceeds Maximum" denials, here's a decision tree flowchart for new AR team agents to follow:

1. Review the claim in BT (Billing Tool) to verify the denial reason and submission status.

2. Check the patient's plan coverage and active MCO plan (if applicable) in the portal.

3. If the claim is for PAP supplies:
   a. Review the FL Medicaid Fee schedule.
   b. If PAP supplies are not listed or covered:
      - Adjust the claim balance as per SOP for Medicaid Waiver claims.
      - Post the adjustment.
   c. If PAP supplies are covered, proceed to step 4.

4. Verify if the claim was submitted to primary insurance (if applicable):
   a. If primary insurance paid, check if the payment exceeds the secondary (Medicaid) allowable amount.
   b. If primary paid more than secondary allows, adjust the claim accordingly.

5. Check if the billed units are correct for the specific HCPCS codes.

6. If the claim is partially paid and partially denied:
   a. Adjust the units to reflect the allowed amount for the paid codes.
   b. For denied codes, proceed to step 7.

7. Determine if an appeal is necessary:
   a. If the denied amount is significant, prepare and send an appeal with supporting documentation.
   b. If the denied amount is minimal (e.g., $1.30), adjust the claim as per SOP.

8. For claims with multiple HCPCS codes:
   a. Review each code individually for coverage and payment status.
   b. Adjust codes that are not covered or exceed the allowable amount.

9. If the claim is for a Medicaid Waiver patient:
   a. Verify if the billed supplies are covered under the waiver program.
   b. If not covered, adjust the claim balance as per SOP for Medicaid Waiver claims.

10. If all steps have been exhausted and the claim is still denied:
    a. Document all actions taken in the claim notes.
    b. Adjust the claim as per SOP for non-covered services or exceeding maximum allowable.

11. Finalize the claim:
    a. Post all necessary adjustments.
    b. Update the claim status in BT.
    c. Document the final resolution in the claim notes.

This flowchart covers the main scenarios encountered in the provided examples while keeping the process as simple as possible for new agents to follow.
