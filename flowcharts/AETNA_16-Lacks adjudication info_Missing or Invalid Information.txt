1. Review claim status in BT (Billing Tool)
   - Check for denial reason and specific details

2. Verify claim information
   - Check claim form, BDM (Billing Data Management), and order notes
   - Confirm diagnosis codes, procedure codes, and patient information

3. If diagnosis code issue:
   - Check PT face sheet and medical records for additional diagnosis codes
   - If alternative diagnosis found, update claim with new code
   - If no alternative found, task client for appropriate diagnosis

4. If procedure code issue:
   - Verify correct modifier usage with previous DOS (Date of Service)
   - Check if patient was in SNF (Skilled Nursing Facility) or inpatient care during DOS
     - If yes, adjust claim and add backend billing if applicable
     - If no, proceed to next step

5. Call insurance (e.g., Aetna at 888-632-3862)
   - Inquire about specific denial reason
   - Verify patient's status (SNF, inpatient, hospice) during DOS

6. Based on insurance response:
   - If patient was in SNF/inpatient/hospice:
     - Adjust claim as insurance won't pay for entire month
     - Add backend billing for future claims if service order is active
   - If incorrect information provided by insurance:
     - Inform representative of correct information
   - If additional information required:
     - Gather necessary information (e.g., UPN, accident info)
     - Update claim with new information

7. Resubmit corrected claim
   - Update diagnosis codes, procedure codes, or other required information
   - Send via appropriate method (e.g., Aetna web portal, BT mailing address)

8. If claim still denied:
   - Consider sending an appeal with supporting documentation
   - For PPO plans with excluded benefits, bill the patient

9. Document all actions taken in claim notes
   - Include details of calls, adjustments, and resubmissions

10. Monitor claim status for resolution
    - If resolved, close the case
    - If not resolved, escalate to supervisor or repeat process as necessary
