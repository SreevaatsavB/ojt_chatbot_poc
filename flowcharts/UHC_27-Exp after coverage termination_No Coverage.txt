Here's a decision tree flowchart for handling claim denials due to No Coverage:

1. Review the claim denial in the billing system (BT or other software).
   - Confirm the denial reason is "No Coverage" or "Exp after coverage termination".

2. Check patient eligibility in the insurance portal (UHC or relevant carrier).
   - Verify the policy termination date.

3. If the policy is terminated before the date of service:
   a. Search for other active insurance plans:
      - Check patient documents in BT.
      - Review medical records.
      - Verify in the insurance portal using patient name and DOB.

4. If no other active insurance is found:
   a. For commercial plans:
      - Bill the balance to the patient.
      - Create a pick-up ticket.
      - Update the insurance termination date in BT.
      - Add notes to the patient's record.
      - Post the transfer of balance to patient responsibility.

   b. For Medicare plans:
      - Check for Medicare eligibility in the portal.
      - If eligible, request re-qualification documents from the client.
      - Place the service order on hold.
      - Once documents are received, recalculate the service order and re-bill to Medicare.

5. If the policy shows as active, but the claim is still denied:
   a. Call the insurance company to verify the reason for denial.
   b. If due to unpaid premiums:
      - Inform the patient about the unpaid premium.
      - Bill the patient for the premium payment.

6. If the patient is deceased:
   a. Verify the date of death.
   b. If DOS is after the date of death:
      - Adjust the claim balance.
      - Create a pick-up.
      - Update termination date, date of death, and patient notes in BT.
      - Post the adjustment.

7. If the claim was paid but later recouped:
   - Bill the patient for the recouped amount.
   - Update patient notes regarding the recoupment.

8. If the policy was renewed or a new policy started after the DOS:
   - Allow time for claim processing if it shows as "in process".
   - If denied, follow steps for billing the patient.

9. For all scenarios:
   - Document all actions taken in the patient notes.
   - Ensure all updates are made in the billing system (BT).

10. If any unique situations arise that don't fit this flowchart:
    - Escalate to a supervisor or experienced team member for guidance.
