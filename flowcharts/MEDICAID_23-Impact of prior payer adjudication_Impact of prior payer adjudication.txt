Here's a decision tree flowchart for handling claim denials due to the impact of prior payer adjudication:

1. Review claim denial in Billing Tool (BT)
   - Verify denial reason: "Impact of prior payer adjudication" or "Primary paid more than secondary"

2. Check EOB (Explanation of Benefits) or remittance advice
   - Compare primary payment amount with secondary allowed amount

3. If primary paid more than secondary allowed:
   a. For standard medical equipment (e.g., E0600, E1390, E1392):
      - Adjust claim as per SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)
      - Apply Medicaid waiver
   b. For PAP (Positive Airway Pressure) supplies (e.g., A7030, A7031, A7034):
      - Verify MCD and MCO plans do not cover PAP supplies
      - Adjust claim as Medicaid waiver

4. If primary paid less than or equal to secondary allowed:
   - Review insurance guidelines for specific HCPCS code
   - Check if code has frequency limitations (e.g., 1 per 2 years)

5. For crossover claims:
   - Verify if claim crossed over from Medicare to Medicaid
   - Check Medicaid portal for specific denial reasons (e.g., 9934 MEDICARE PAID MORE THAN MEDICAID ALLOWS)

6. If adjustment is needed:
   - Create new invoice for correct DOS if necessary
   - Adjust claim in BT
   - Post adjustment

7. If further investigation is required:
   - Check previous DOS for similar denials
   - Review allowed amounts in portal remittance

8. For ongoing claims:
   - Set follow-up timeframe (e.g., 30-45 business days)
   - Contact insurance representative for claim status update

9. If appeal is necessary:
   - Submit appeal to appropriate insurance (e.g., Simply Health care patient MCO)
   - Track appeal status and follow up as needed

10. If claim is still denied after all steps:
    - Adjust balance as per insurance guidelines
    - Write off as Medicaid waiver if appropriate

11. Document all actions taken in claim notes for future reference
