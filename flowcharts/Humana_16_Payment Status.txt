Based on the provided claim notes, here's a decision tree flowchart for handling paid balance adjustment claims:

1. Review claim in software (Caretend/Availity)
   - Check if claim is partially paid or fully paid

2. If partially paid:
   a. Check in Waystar for EOB
      - If EOB found, review details
      - If no EOB found, proceed to next step

   b. Check in Availity for claim processing details
      - Verify allowed amount, paid amount, and patient responsibility

   c. Compare payment with fee schedule
      - If payment matches fee schedule, proceed to step 3
      - If payment is less than fee schedule, proceed to step 4

   d. If payment is more than fee schedule:
      - Place adjustment form in Connect portal
      - Task client to adjust remaining balance as contractual adjustment

3. If fully paid:
   a. Record payment details (EFT number, date, amount)
   b. Download EOB from web portal
   c. Place EOB in path BKTask for client posting

4. If underpaid or denied:
   a. Check billing note history for any previous resubmissions
   b. If claim was resubmitted, review the changes made (e.g., removing secondary DX code)
   c. If not resubmitted or still denied after resubmission:
      - Call insurance (e.g., Humana) for clarification
      - Request claim reprocessing if applicable
      - Note ticket number and expected timeframe for reprocessing

5. For small dollar balances (typically under $6):
   - Adjust balance as small dollar adjustment
   - Task claim to client for contractual adjustment

6. For denied codes not recognized by Medicare Advantage plans (e.g., S0164):
   - Review previous invoices for similar denials
   - Place adjustment form in Connect
   - Task claim to client for contractual adjustment

7. If appeal is necessary:
   - Submit appeal with required documentation
   - Monitor claim status in Waystar for reprocessing

8. After all actions:
   - Set follow-up reminder (typically 15-30 days from last action)
   - Document all actions taken in claim notes

This flowchart covers the main scenarios encountered in the provided claim notes and offers a structured approach for new agents to handle paid balance adjustment claims.
