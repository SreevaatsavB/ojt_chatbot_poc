1. Check the claim status in BT (Billing Tool) or portal
   - If claim is still in process, allow standard processing time (usually 45-60 days)
   - If claim is denied, proceed to next step

2. Review client notes and portal AR notes
   - If notes indicate to write-off or transfer bill to patient, follow those instructions
   - If no specific instructions, proceed to next step

3. Verify if appeal/reconsideration has been sent
   - If not sent, prepare and submit appeal/reconsideration
   - If already sent, proceed to next step

4. Call insurance (CareCentrix in most cases) to check appeal status
   - If appeal is still open and processing, note the status and allow more time
   - If appeal is closed, ask for specific reason and proceed to next step

5. Check if additional documents are required
   - If yes, gather necessary documents (e.g., RX, Notes, DT) and resubmit
   - If no, proceed to next step

6. Verify authorization status
   - If authorization is suspended or missing, request new authorization
   - If authorization is valid, proceed to next step

7. Check if claim was rejected due to subscriber ID issues
   - If yes, verify member information in Availity and resubmit claim
   - If no, proceed to next step

8. Determine if all appeal options have been exhausted
   - If yes, adjust the claim as per SOP or client instructions
   - If no, consider submitting another appeal

9. If claim is still unresolved:
   - Escalate to supervisor or client for further instructions
   - Consider requesting client approval for write-off or adjustment

10. Document all actions taken in the claim notes for future reference

Remember to use appropriate software at each step:
- BT (Billing Tool) for claim status and notes
- CareCentrix portal for claim submission and status checks
- Availity for member information verification
- Zirmed/Waystar for claim resubmission when necessary

Always allow appropriate processing time between actions and follow up regularly until the claim is resolved.
