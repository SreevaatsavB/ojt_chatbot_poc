Claim denied as not covered by payer:

1. Review claim status in BT (Billing Tool)
   - Check if claim was submitted to the correct payer

2. Verify patient's insurance coverage
   - Check FL Medicaid portal for active MCO plan
   - If different from billed insurance, proceed to step 3
   - If same as billed insurance, proceed to step 4

3. Update insurance information in BT
   - Term incorrect insurance
   - Add correct insurance as primary

   - If instructed to submit to non-contracted payer (e.g., Little Havana):
     - Bill the patient as per SOP
   - If not, proceed to step 8
