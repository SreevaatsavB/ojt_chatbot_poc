Here's a decision tree flowchart for handling claim denials due to Prior Payer Impact:

1. Review claim denial in BT (Billing Tool)
   - Verify denial reason is "23-Impact of prior payer adjudication"

2. Check EOB (Explanation of Benefits)
   - Review primary payer's payment information
   - Compare primary payment to secondary allowed amount

3. If primary paid more than secondary allowed:
   a. Review Medicaid fee schedule (for Simply Health Care)
   b. If service is not covered (e.g., PAP supplies):
      - Adjust claim as Medicaid waiver
      - Post adjustment in BT
   c. If service is covered:
      - Adjust claim balance
      - Write off the difference

4. If primary paid less than secondary allowed:
   a. Check if secondary eclaim was calculated correctly
   b. If not, send corrected claim with proper calculation

5. If claim denied for duplicate service:
   a. Check primary invoice for duplicate billing
   b. If confirmed duplicate, adjust claim as per SOP

6. If denial persists:
   a. Prepare appeal with necessary documents (medical records, EOB)
   b. Submit appeal via web portal (e.g., Availity)
   c. Note appeal reference number

7. After submitting appeal:
   a. Check appeal status regularly
   b. Allow 30-45 business days for processing

8. If appeal is upheld:
   a. Review RSM (Regional Sales Manager) update
   b. Consider sending 2nd level appeal if advised

9. If appeal is denied:
   a. Review client update for adjustment approval
   b. Adjust claim based on previous similar denials

10. For ongoing denials:
    a. Consult RSM for guidance
    b. Consider policy limitations (e.g., 1 unit per month for PAP codes)
    c. Adjust claims accordingly

11. Document all actions in claim notes in BT

12. If unable to resolve:
    a. Task client for further action
    b. Await further instructions
