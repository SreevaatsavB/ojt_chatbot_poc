Based on the provided claim denial scenarios for "Correction Required" (COR), here's a decision tree flowchart for new AR team agents to handle such denials:

1. Review claim status in the system (BT, Payspan, or other relevant software)
   - Identify the denial reason as COR (Correction Required)

2. Check the specific requirements for processing the claim
   - Look for any notes in COR or other relevant systems

3. If Medical Records (MR) are required:
   a. Check in BDM for available documentation (CMN, DT, progress notes, sleep test)
   b. If documentation is available:
      - Send MR through the insurance portal
      - Raise an appeal with the available documentation
   c. If documentation is not available:
      - Task the client for required MR
      - Once received, submit MR and raise an appeal

4. If primary EOB is required (for secondary claims):
   a. Check if there's a primary insurance
   b. If yes, obtain primary EOB and submit
   c. If no, inform the patient to update COB with the insurance

5. If claim was paid to another provider:
   a. Request additional provider information from the insurance
   b. Allow time for processing (typically 15-20 days)
   c. Follow up if information is not received

6. If rejection is found:
   a. Identify the reason for rejection
   b. Rectify the issue
   c. Resubmit the claim

7. If premium payments are past due:
   a. Verify the grace period
   b. If within grace period, allow time for processing
   c. If outside grace period, bill the patient

8. For all appeals:
   - Note the Timely Filing Limit (TFL), usually 90 days from the denial date
   - Submit the appeal through the insurance portal before the TFL expires

9. If unable to resolve through the above steps:
   a. Contact insurance representative for clarification
   b. Follow their instructions for resolution

10. Allow time for processing after resubmission or appeal
    - Follow up if no response is received within a reasonable timeframe

11. Document all actions taken in the claim notes for future reference

This flowchart covers the main scenarios encountered in the provided examples while keeping the process simple for new agents to follow.
