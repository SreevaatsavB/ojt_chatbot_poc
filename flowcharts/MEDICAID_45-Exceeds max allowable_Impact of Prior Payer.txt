Claim denied due to Impact of Prior Payer:

1. Review claim in BT (Billing Tool) to check claim submission status and payment details.

2. Verify if claim has been crossed over from primary insurance (usually Medicare) to secondary insurance (Medicaid).

3. Review EOB (Explanation of Benefits) from secondary insurance to understand the specific denial reason.

4. Check primary payer details in BT to verify the primary payment amount.

5. Review Medicaid fee schedule to determine secondary allowable amount for each HCPCS code.

6. Compare primary payment amount with secondary allowable amount for each code:
   a. If primary paid more than secondary allowable:
      - Adjust the claim in BT
      - Write off the balance as Medicaid Waiver (if applicable)
   b. If primary paid less than secondary allowable:
      - Investigate further for potential billing errors

7. For PAP (Positive Airway Pressure) supplies:
   a. Check if base item (e.g., E0470, E0601) was paid
   b. Verify if supplies were denied
   c. If supplies denied:
      - Adjust denied codes as Medicaid Waiver
      - Write off per SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) for Medicaid Waiver

8. If claim is for multiple HCPCS codes:
   a. Review each code individually
   b. Adjust or write off as necessary based on primary payment vs. secondary allowable
