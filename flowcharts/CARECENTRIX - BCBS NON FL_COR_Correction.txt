Based on the provided claim denial scenarios, here's a decision tree flowchart for new agents to handle claim denials due to corrections:

1. Review the claim in BT (Billing Tool) to check submission status and denial reason.

2. If denial is due to missing authorization:
   a. Verify if authorization exists in the system.
   b. If authorization exists, submit a reconsideration with the authorization sheet.
   c. If authorization doesn't exist, request authorization from the insurance provider.

3. If denial is due to rental purchase guidelines not met:
   a. Submit a reconsideration with supporting documentation.
   b. If reconsideration is upheld, proceed to submit an appeal.

4. After submitting reconsideration or appeal:
   a. Follow up with insurance provider (via phone or web portal) to verify receipt.
   b. If not received, resubmit the reconsideration or appeal.

5. Monitor for response to reconsideration or appeal:
   a. If approved, update claim status in BT.
   b. If denied again, proceed to next level of appeal (if available).

6. If all appeal levels are exhausted:
   a. Check if Timely Filing Limit (TFL) has passed.
   b. If TFL passed, adjust the claim as per SOP.

7. If claim reaches maximum number of benefits:
   a. Verify with insurance provider if this is accurate.
   b. If confirmed, adjust the claim as needed.

8. Throughout the process:
   a. Document all actions, conversations, and reference numbers in the claim notes.
   b. Adhere to specific Timely Filing Limits for each action.
   c. Use appropriate communication channels (phone, web portal) as specified by the insurance provider.

9. If any unique situations arise:
   a. Consult with a supervisor or experienced team member.
   b. Update the process documentation for future reference.
